# OCR Projects with Python ðŸ§ ðŸ“„

This repository contains projects and notebooks from the [Udemy course: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/ocr-optical-character-recognition-in-python/), where we build OCR pipelines using:

- ðŸŸ£ Tesseract OCR
- ðŸŸ¢ OpenCV for image processing
- ðŸŸ¡ EasyOCR for deep learning-based recognition
- ðŸ”µ EAST for text detection in natural scenes
- ðŸ§  CNN models for custom OCR

## ðŸ”§ Topics Covered
- Text extraction from images and documents
- Preprocessing techniques: thresholding, resizing, denoising
- Real-world OCR: license plates, scenes, noisy backgrounds
- NLP applications: word clouds, NER, summarization
- Custom OCR with deep learning models
